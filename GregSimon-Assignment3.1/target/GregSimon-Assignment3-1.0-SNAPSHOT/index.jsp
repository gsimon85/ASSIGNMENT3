  <h2>Etymology</h2>
  <img class="rightImage" src="images/Arnold_the_red_and_black_haired_dachshund.jpg" alt="Picture of dachshund" width="400" >
  <p>The name dachshund is of German origin, and means 'badger dog', from Dachs ('badger') and Hund ('dog, hound'). The
    German word Dachshund is pronounced [ˈdaks.hʊnt] ⓘ. The pronunciation varies in English: variations of the first and
    second syllables include /ˈdɑːks-/, /ˈdæks-/ and /-hʊnt/, /-hʊnd/, /-ənd/. It may be incorrectly pronounced as
    /ˈdæʃ-/hound by some English speakers. Although Dachshund is a German word, in modern Germany, the dogs are
    more commonly known by the short name Dackel. Working dogs are less commonly known as Teckel.

    Because of their long, narrow build, they are often nicknamed wiener or sausage dog.</p>

  <h2>Classification</h2>
  <p>While classified in the hound group or scent hound group in the United States and Great Britain, the breed has its
    own group in the countries which belong to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (World Canine Federation).[12]
    Many dachshunds, especially the wire-haired subtype, may exhibit behavior and appearance similar to the terrier
    group of dogs.[13] An argument can be made for the scent (or hound) group classification because the breed was
    developed to use scent to trail and hunt animals, and probably descended from the Saint Hubert Hound like many
    modern scent hound breeds such as bloodhounds and Basset Hounds; but with the persistent personality and love for
    digging that probably developed from the terrier, it can also be argued that they could belong in the terrier, or
    "earth dog", group</p>
